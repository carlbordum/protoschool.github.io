We've created a text file containing a secret message and stored it on the IPFS network under CID `QmWCscor6qWPdx53zEQmZvQvuWQYxx1ARRCXwYVE4s9wzJ`. Copy it from the IPFS network into your `/some/stuff` directory in MFS and give it the name `success.txt` by appending the desired filename to the destination path.

**Hint:** An IPFS path starts with `/ipfs/` and ends with a CID.
