When we add a file to MFS using `files.write`, there's no value returned
by the method, but we can still check to ensure everything worked as expected.

In the Mutable File System, we can inspect directories using the [`files.ls`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesls)
method. It should feel very familiar if you've ever used the command line to list
the contents of directories on your computer.

The `files.ls` method looks like this:

```js
await ipfs.files.ls([path], [options])
```

The method will default to listing the contents of your root directory ( `/` ), or
you can choose to specify a specific `path` (directory) you'd like to inspect,
such as `/catPics`,

`files.ls` produces an array of objects, one for each file or directory
contained in the directory you're inspecting, with the following properties:

- `name` (default): the file's name
- `type` (optional with `{ long: true }`): the object's type (`0` - file or `1` - directory)
- `size` (optional with `{ long: true }`): the size of the file in bytes
- `hash` (optional with `{ long: true }`): the crytographic hash, or Content Identifier (CID), that represents your file in IPFS

*Gotcha!* To return values for *all* of those properties, you must use the
option `{ long: true }`. Otherwise all properties except for the `name` field will be
present but their values will be returned as `0` (for `size` and `type`) or `""` (for `hash`).

If we wanted to view all available details for the contents of a `/catPics`
directory, we could do it like this:

```js
await ipfs.files.ls('/catPics', { long: true })
```

You can learn more about other options in the [`files.ls` API documentation](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesls).
