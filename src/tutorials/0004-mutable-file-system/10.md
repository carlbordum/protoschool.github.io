MFS has a [`files.read`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesread) method that allows you to display the contents of a file in a *buffer*. This allows us to easily read the contents of a `.txt` file among others.

The method takes this format:

```js
await ipfs.files.read(path, [options])
```

The `path` provided is the path of the file to read, and it must point to a file rather than a directory.

The `files.read` method returns a Buffer, which can be converted to a string using the method `toString('utf8')`. For example:

```js
let bufferedContents = await ipfs.files.read('/directory/some-file.txt')  // a buffer
let contents = bufferedContents.toString('utf8') // a string
```

or

```js
let contents = (await ipfs.files.read('/directory/some-file.txt')).toString('utf8') // a string
// notice the parentheses around the entire await statement
```

When you're ready to try this in the real world, you should note that `files.read` method can result in heavy memory usage based on the contents of the file being read. You might want to explore the [`files.readReadableStream`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesreadreadablestream) or [`files.readPullStream`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#filesreadpullstream) methods instead.
