A content identifier, or **CID**, is a hash used to point to material in [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). It doesn't indicate where the content is stored, but it forms a kind of address based on the content itself. CIDs are short, regardless of the size of their underlying content.

Here's what it might look like: [`QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/Aardvark.html)

To generate this hash, we can use a **cryptographic algorithm** that maps input of arbitrary size (data/file) to output of a fixed size (cryptographic hash or also known as fingerprint).

The used **cryptographic algorithm** should generate hashes that have the following characteristics:

- **Deterministic**: the same input should always produce the same hash.
- **Uncorrelated**: a small change in the input should generate a completly different hash
- **One-way**: It should be infeasible to reconstruct the data from the hash
- **Unique**: only one file can produce one specific hash

There are many hashing algorithms out there like `sha1`, `sha2-256`, `sha3-256`, `sha3-512`, `shake-256`, etc.
IPFS uses **`sha2-256`** by default.
