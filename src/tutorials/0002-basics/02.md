One important feature of [Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) (DAGs) is the ability to link them together.

The way you express links in the IPFS DAG store is with the `CID` of
another node.

For example, one node might have a link called `foo` pointed
to another CID instance previously saved as `barCid`, like so:

```javascript
{
  foo: barCid
}
```

When we give a field a name and make its value a link to a CID, as shown above,
we call this a **named link**.

We can add named links to IPFS in the same way we add any other data:

```javascript
await ipfs.dag.put({ foo: barCid })
```
