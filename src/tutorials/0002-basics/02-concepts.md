**CID** - Content Identifier. An unique address for a block of data in IPFS that is derived from its content.

**DAG** - Directed Acyclic Graph. Blocks in IPFS form a graph as they can point to other blocks by their CID. These links can only point one direction (directed) and across the whole graph there are no loops or cycles (acyclic).
