As we've discussed, the decentralized web depends on linked data structures. Let's explore
what those look like.

## Merkle trees
A [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) (or simple "hash tree") is a data structure in which every node is hashed.

```
               +--------+
               |        |
     +---------+  root  +---------+
     |         |        |         |
     |         +----+---+         |
     |              |             |
+----v-----+  +-----v----+  +-----v----+
|          |  |          |  |          |
|  node A  |  |  node B  |  |  node C  |
|          |  |          |  |          |
+----------+  +-----+----+  +-----+----+
                    |             |
              +-----v----+  +-----v----+
              |          |  |          |
              |  node D  |  |  node E  +-------+
              |          |  |          |       |
              +----------+  +-----+----+       |
                                  |            |
                            +-----v----+  +----v-----+
                            |          |  |          |
                            |  node F  |  |  node G  |
                            |          |  |          |
                            +----------+  +----------+
```

In a Merkle tree, nodes point to other nodes by their content addresses (hashes). (Remember,
when we run data through a cryptographic hash, we get back a "hash" or "content address"
that we can think of as a link, so a Merkle tree is a collection of linked nodes.)

As previously discussed, all content addresses are unique to the data they represent. In the graph above, `node E` contains a reference to the hash for `node F` and `node G`. This means that the content address (hash) of `node E` is unique to a node containing those addresses.

Getting lost? Let's imagine this as a set of directories, or file folders. If we run directory E through our hashing algorithm
while it contains subdirectories F and G, the content-derived hash we get back will include references to those two directories. If we remove directory G, it's like Grace removing that whisker from her kitten photo. Directory E doesn't have the same contents anymore, so it gets a new hash.

As the tree above is built, the final content address (hash) of the root node is unique to a
tree that contains every node all the way down this tree. If the data in any node were
to change even by a single byte, the hash of the changed node would change, as would the hashes
of all of its parent nodes.

In case you haven't noticed, this means that as a programmer you'll always need to build
these data structures backwards, from the leaf nodes on up to the root node.

## Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)

![Directed Acycil Graphs](tutorial-assets/T0001L01-dag.svg)

DAG is an acronym for [`Directed Acyclic Graph`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph). It's a fancy way of describing a
specific kind of Merkle tree (hash tree) where different branches in the tree can point at other branches
in the tree in a single forward direction, as illustrated by the image above.
