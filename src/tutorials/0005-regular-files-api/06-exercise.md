Use `ls` to list the contents of the directory you created in the previous exercise.

**Hint:** The CID of the directory you created in the previous exercise has been stored for you in the directoryCID variable in the starter code below. Because the last element in the results returned by the `add` method is always the wrapping directory, our code finds that last element and saves its `hash` value, or CID.
