Now that we've wrapped some files in a directory in our IPFS node, let's learn how we can check its contents. If you use the command line frequently, you're familiar with the `ls` command. IPFS offers a similar `ls` method to list the contents of a directory. However, as with the `cat` method we saw earlier, `ls` will actually look for the requested directory on your own node first, then search the broader network if needed. Because of the way cryptographic hashing works, two directories with identical CIDs are guaranteed to have identical contents, regardless of which peers are hosting them.

You can call the `ls` method like so:

```javascript
await ipfs.ls(ipfsPath)
```

The `ipfsPath` argument can take many formats, the simplest of which is a CID. (Remember, that's the same string value we saw returned to us as `hash` when we used the `add` command.) For example:

```javascript
await ipfs.ls("Qmeybqr2GaiUyGSRWX3dhS2Qz6VTVBXzBiYiFcKpYFJ7tH")
```

You can explore other `ipfsPath` formatting options in the [`ls` documentation for the Regular Files API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/FILES.md#ls).

The `ls` method in the Regular Files API returns an array of objects, one for each file or directory found, structured like so:

```javascript
{
  "hash": string,
  "path": string,
  "name": string,
  "depth": number,
  "size": number,
  "type": string // can be "file" or "dir"
}
```


Note that there's a different `ls` method in the MFS API (called as `ipfs.files.ls()` rather than `ipfs.ls`) with slightly different properties, which you can learn more about in our MFS tutorial.
