Need to know more about an IPFS file or directory beyond just its contents? Whereas `cat` retrieves just the buffered content of a file, we can access addtional metadata about a file or directory by calling the `get` method like so:

```javascript
await ipfs.get(ipfsPath)
```

The result is an array of objects, one per file or directory, with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    hash: string,
    name: string,
    path: string,
    depth: number,
    size: number,
    type: string, //can be "file" or "dir"
    content: Buffer, // only exists if the type === "file"
}
```

As with `cat` and `ls`, the `get` method will search for the requested file or directory on the IPFS network if it can't find it on your local node.

## The use case for `get` versus `cat` or `ls`

#### Returning both metadata and content

The `get` method returns metadata for all files and subdirectories, as well as content for all files.

Notice that the data returned by `get` (as shown above) is structured almost identically to the result of the `ls` method, except that we now see contents returned (if the target is a file) _in addition to_ metadata.

In the case of a file, `get` returns metadata _in addition to_ the buffered content we could have retrieved using `cat`.

#### Returning directory contents recursively

Another very important distinction between `get` and these other methods is that, when run on a directory, it will retrieve contents **recursively**, meaning that the resulting array will contain an entry for the specified directory itself as well as every subdirectory and every file present inside the specified directory, even those inside of subdirectories.

By contrast, the `ls` method returns an array with metadata only for the top-level contents within the specified directory (whether files or subdirectories). It doesn't return an entry for the specified directory itself and it doesn't return entries for the contents of subdirectories.

The `get` method can:

- Recursively retrieve every file and subdirectory in a directory
- Tell us which entries are directories and which are files
- Inform us of the size of a file
- Pinpoint the depth of a file in the directory structure
- and offer many other details
