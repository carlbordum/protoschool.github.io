With every blog post linked together, we can return all of them by referencing only the CID of the last. This kind of traversal could be used to create an overview page that lists all blog posts chronologically.

The `prev` field contains a link to the previous blog post. You can use that CID and the [`ipfs.dag.get`](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-js-ipfs-core/blob/master/SPEC/DAG.md#dagget) API to get the previous blog, and then use its `prev` field to get the one before that. A perfect use case for a while loop!

Note that the `ipfs.dag.get()` API returns an object with a `value` attribute which is the node you want and contains the original fields you saved. For example, we could find the author of the post about dogs like so:

```javascript
const dogPostAuthor = (await ipfs.dag.get(dogPostCid)).value.author
```

Notice the parentheses used around `await ipfs.dag.get(dogPostCid)` above, since the async function needs to complete before the CID object with a property of `value` is available. When you're using this code in practice, it's important not to make too many async calls that will create lag time.
