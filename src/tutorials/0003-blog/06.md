You want to create an overview page that lists your blog posts chronologically.

You *could* do it the same way as we did with tags. However, you would need to update that page (create a new node) every time you added a new blog post. It sounds wasteful to create a new node with every small change.

Thereâ€™s a better way! Whenever you create a new blog post, you can link to the previous one directly. This enables you to walk those links to create the chronological overview page dynamically, as we'll see in the next lesson.

We know the CID of a blog post as soon as it is stored in IPFS. We can use that CID to link from newer blog posts to older ones.
