A single object can have many links to other nodes. To illustrate this, let's create new nodes which could be used for a tag cloud.

Until now, we've been using named links, meaning that we create a named field with a single link as its value, such as:

```javascript
{
  author: samCid
}
```
However, we can also choose to gather links into an array without naming each one individually.

```javascript
{
  links: [natCid, samCid]
}
```

This is perfect for our use case, where a single tag should be associated with many posts, like so:

```javascript
{
  tag: "name-of-the-tag",
  posts: [/* links to the CIDs */]
}
```

Please note that arrays are order-dependent. This means that two arrays with the same links in a different order will get different CIDs.
